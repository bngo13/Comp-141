1 GCC can be used to compile a C program to object files and link them into an executable, in a single step
	gcc hello.c
2 GCC can directly compile the source code to object files
	gcc -c hello.c
3 GCC includes the capability to invoke the linker that collects a bunch of object files into an executable.
	gcc hello.o
4 GCC can compile the source code to Assembly language.
	gcc -S hello.c
5  GCC includes the capability to invoke the assembler that translates the Assembly code into object files.
