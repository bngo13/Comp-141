	a.
		Since n has to be equal to an integer, n must be an integer
		"call" must be an int because n is multiplied with a number, thus B must be an integer
		int -> int
	b.
		The first call of g has input of call, the second call of g has input of α, thus the input of g has to be α
			β = α -> β
		The second call of g has a function output of α, thus the return type of g must be α
			β = α -> α
		The first call of the function f has an output of α, thus the function f must return α
		
		(α -> α) * α -> α
